# PhpStorm Theme: Netbeans Default Light 

This is a port of the default light theme for Netbeans. 

This is the easiest light theme to use for Tritanomaly color blind users
(or at least, it is for me).

## Do You Have Tritanomaly?

Try this:

If you notice slight difference between "Normal" and "Tritanomaly",
you have the very rare form of color blindness. For the most part
you should only have a lack of sensitivity to blue light. It's
very possible you haven't even noticed!

## PhpStorm Theme Installation

Check this guide for cross-platform instructions:

In short, put the `.icls` file in your PhpStorm `config/colors`
directory.

## Contributing

Settings are ported as I see differences while working with different
pieces of code. There are likely many file types I've missed -
feel free to submit a pull request with your changes.
